# About Zen Grids

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/JohnAlbin/zen-grids.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Zen Grids is an intuitive, flexible grid system that leverages the natural source order of your content to make it easier to create fluid responsive designs. With an easy-to-use Sass mixin set, the Zen Grids system can be applied to an infinite number of layouts, including responsive, adaptive, fluid and fixed-width layouts.

## USAGE

Here's a simple example: a content column with a sidebar on each side, aligned to a 12 column grid.

```scss
  @import "zen-grids";

  $zen-gutters: 40px;  // Set the gutter size. A half-gutter is used on
                       // each side of each column.

  .container {
    @include zen-grid-container();  // Define the container for your grid items.
  }

  $zen-columns: 12;  // Set the number of grid columns to use in this media
                     // query. You'll likely want a different grid for
                     // different screen sizes.

  @media all and (min-width: 50em) {
    .sidebar1 {
      @include zen-grid-item(3, 1);   // Span 3 columns starting in 1st column.
    }
    .content {
      @include zen-grid-item(6, 4);   // Span 6 columns starting in 4th column.
    }
    .sidebar2 {
      @include zen-grid-item(3, 10);  // Span 3 columns starting in 10th column.
    }
  }
```

Within the `.container` element, the `.sidebar1`, `.sidebar2` and `.content` elements can be in any order.
